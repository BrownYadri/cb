	<h1> high school freahman year bucket list </h1>
	
	
	<h3> by. Andreana brown, January 10, 2020</h3>
	<p> Contrary to what some sources claim, your freahman year of high school does matter. For tons of incoming freahman, tis year will mark the begining of the lomg, arduous journy to college. And if you're a freahman, though you certanily don't have to stress over college this early, this is a great year to get yourself on the right path! 
	<br>
		Here is a great bucket list of things to do your freahman year!
	 </p>
	
	<h2> 1) Get organized </h2>
	
	<p>In middle school, it’s easy to get away with disorganization. In high school, with six different classes all over the campus, strange new schedules, and a bunch of people you’ve never met before, organization is key to staying sane! Buy sticky notes, a few three-ring binders with dividers, notebooks, highlighters…whatever it takes to keep you on track! Also, those calendar organizers (or reminder binders, as my school calls them) that are given out at the beginning of the school year are more crucial than they appear. You can write down all your homework and assignments in them, and they’ll be a life-saver to you for the rest of high school…so make sure to use them!</p>

	<h2> 2) Participate in the club community </h2>
	<p>Find a club that interests you, and join one. Clubs are awesome in that you can meet with people who enjoy similar things that you do, make a whole bunch of new friends, and participate in lots of cool activities. If you’re very involved with a certain club, this could also be great for college apps (in the very far-off future!).</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Alternatively, you can also start a club! You can invite friends to join and meet new people through recruitment. It’s a great way to really get involved in your high school. Also, being a club president for all four years of high school is a great way to show colleges your commitment and drive.</p>

	<h2> 3) looking into AP and SAT classes </h2>
	
	<p>This might seem intimidating, but seriously: take the leap! Taking challenging honors or AP classes is a great way to grow mentally and improve your GPA. Teachers definitely demand a lot more in high school, and this is going to sound cheesy…but if you believe you can do it, and you work hard at it, those classes are perfectly doable. If you’re trying your best and the classes are still too difficult for you, then you can always drop out; but, if you never try at all, you won’t be tapping your full potential!</p>

	<h2> 4) looking at AP and SAT subject test</h2>
	
		<p>I know it isn’t the most appealing item on this bucket list, but these tests really are important. I had no idea what an SAT Subject test was during my freshman year—the year I took Biology. Therefore, while I took the AP Biology test that year, I didn’t take the subject test until I learned about it sophomore year. By then, I’d already forgotten a lot of the material and had to re-study. Don’t make my mistake! If you’re already taking an honors class, you could easily buy a prep book and study for the corresponding AP and SAT Subject test, too.</p>
	<br> 
	<p>You don’t have to even take the class to take its AP test. If you’re really into psychology, for example, you can buy an AP Psychology prep book and self-study. You shouldn’t overburden yourself with a whole bunch of these tests your freshman year, but it’s a good idea to get started on at least one or two.</p>

		 <h2> 5) find your niche!</h2>
	
	<p>This is so integral to high school! Find what you like and what you’re good at, and find a community in your high school with fosters this. For example, if you’re really into acting, take drama classes, join the Drama Club, and maybe even try out for a few school productions. Try out for a sport if you’re athletic, or if you play an instrument, join the school band or orchestra. There are so many options out there. Just make sure not to seclude yourself from the rest of the high school community! This will also prove to be beneficial to you in the long run because colleges like seeing concentrated extracurriculars—that is, an applicant which is very strong in a certain niche. The earlier, the better. It’s a little too late to start looking your senior year.</p>

	<h1>6) Befriend upperclassman</h1>
	<p>They really aren’t that scary in reality! When you first enter high school, everyone will look so intimidating—especially the juniors and seniors. I remember entering high school, seeing someone with a fully grown beard, and freaking out. Friendships with upperclassmen, however, are some of the most rewarding friendships high school has to offer. Upperclassmen are almost done with high school. They’ve taken the classes you’re going to take and have countless pieces of advice to offer. They’re also great tutors and can show you around campus if you’re lost—don’t miss out! Snag one while you can. Inside that hormonal, sleep-deprived shell is an actual human being.</p>
